# **Clean Node API**
## [**Link for the complete course (in portuguese)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/?referralCode=B53CE5CA2B9AFA5A6FA1)

This API is the result of the course made by the professor Rodrigo Manguinho, aka "Mango" in Udemy.

The main goal of this course is show how to create an API with an api with an architecture well defined and decoupled, using TDD (Test Driven Development) as work methodology, Clean Architecture for make the distribution of the responsibilities in layers, always following the SOLID principles, and whenever possible, applying Design
Patterns to solve common problems.
